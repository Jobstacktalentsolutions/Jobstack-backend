# Project Context: JobStack Platform

## What We Are Building

JobStack is a two-sided marketplace designed to simplify the hiring process for businesses by acting as a high-touch recruitment agency platform. We are building the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to launch in the Nigerian market, starting with Lagos.

## Core Value Proposition

We remove the burden of sourcing, vetting, and payment administration from businesses. Recruiters submit a role, the agency handles the full vetting process (for both low-skilled and high-skilled jobs), and the business is presented with the top matched candidate.

## Key Business Logic

1.  **Two-Sided Roles:** The system must clearly distinguish between **Recruiters** (Businesses) and **Job Seekers** (Talent), although there is an extra role for admins.
2.  **Agency Vetting:** The platform enables agency admins to manage the detailed vetting status and documentation of all Job Seekers.
3.  **Payment Flow:** The system facilitates payments from Recruiters to the Agency, and then from the Agency to the Talent (handling both contract and employment payments).

## Scope Focus

The MVP focuses on the core user journeys: Recruiter job posting, Job Seeker profile creation/application, and the Agency's internal vetting/matching/admin dashboard workflow.
